		<h1>Welcome to my personal realm.</h1>
		<h2>Why does it look dull</h2>
		<p>Well uh... I'm just too lazy to learn web design.</p>

		<h3>Today's Topic.</strong></h3>
		<p>Nothing OMEGALUL. Why add topics if this whole website thingie is just a test :].</p>

		<h3>#3: Changing stuff for <em><u>no reason</u></em> </h3>
		<p class="why">With the launch of chapter 2, Epic changed a lot of things that were just fine, And did not need to be changed</p>
		<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/10/15/fortnite-patch-notes-11-of-the-biggest-changes-chapter-2/#596df1134e32" target="_blank"><img src="Chapter2.jpg"></a></br>
		<p>Epic did things such as nerf the pump, and now it's useless unless it's a purple or gold pump, and that is VERY hard to find. They also: changed the UI, spectating system, and got rid of almost everything. Clearly they didn't hear the saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"</p>

<p>That's all the room I've got, so Have a great day!</p>
