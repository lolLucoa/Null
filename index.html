		<h3>#2: No communication</h3>
		<img src="NoInfo.jpg" width="238" height= "250">
		<p>When Epic games launched chapter 2 (or season 11), they didn't include patch notes, and this understandablity upset a lot of the competive community, as they want to know what changed for their games that have money on the line, but epic is giving us radio silence. They recently changed the reload times of EVERYTHING and didn't tell us and we had to figure it out ourself, and they still will not comment on any changes besides new outfits.</p>

		<h3>#3: Changing stuff for <em><u>no reason</u></em> </h3>
		<p class="why">With the launch of chapter 2, Epic changed a lot of things that were just fine, And did not need to be changed</p>
		<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/10/15/fortnite-patch-notes-11-of-the-biggest-changes-chapter-2/#596df1134e32" target="_blank"><img src="Chapter2.jpg"></a></br>
		<p>Epic did things such as nerf the pump, and now it's useless unless it's a purple or gold pump, and that is VERY hard to find. They also: changed the UI, spectating system, and got rid of almost everything. Clearly they didn't hear the saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"</p>

<p>That's all the room I've got, so Have a great day!</p>
