		<h1>Welcome to my personal realm.</h1>
		<h2>Why does it look so dull?</h2>
		<p>Well uh... I'm just too lazy to learn web design.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>???</strong></h3>
		<h2>I get blamed for everything.</h2>
		<h4>I don't know why, but talking to people relieves me as it gives me a reason to continue my day. No, it's not sending Personal Messages / Direct Messages, I'm talking about getting into a voice call with them and hanging out. It's honestly a shame that my inconsistency just ruins my friendship with everybody. Is it my fault? Hell yeah. Should I try to normalize my personality? Nah, my personality is honestly so weird that I wouldn't be surprised if people wanted me to kill myself thanks to it. OH WAIT.</h4>
